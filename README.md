A modified version of the soft colour scheme by [Noah Frederick](http://noahfrederick.com/) called [Peppermint](http://noahfrederick.com/blog/2011/lion-terminal-theme-peppermint/).

####Dotfiles
This theme is designed to be used in conjunction with [my dotfiles][1]. Originally they were part of the same repository but to clean things up I decided to separate them.

####Colour scheme is available for
* Terminal.app (OS X Default)
* [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/)

####Feedback
I __love__ feedback. Find me on twitter, [@_jacobtomlinson](https://www.twitter.com/_jacobtomlinson), and tell me what you think about piperita!

###Installation
Each supported terminal application has a subdirectory in the `schemes` directory. See the `INSTALL.md` in each subdirectory for installation instructions.

Then follow the installation instructions from [my dotfiles][1] if you want those too!
